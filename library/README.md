Mobile Controller
=================

Welcome
--------
Hello and welcome fellow developer! This repository contains the code of the Mobile Controller library. If you're into web based
game development you might be very interested.

What Is the Mobile Controller Library?
--------------------------------------
The Mobile Controller library makes it easier on you to develop web based games that utilize the player's mobile phone, Android or IPhone, as an advanced customized controller. The client side (browser) part of Mobile Controller does not depend on any other library, and a player does not need to install anything on her phone in order to start playing your game. It is recommended that the player has a QR reader on her phone and a modern browser. See the section on limitations.

How Does It Work?
-----------------
The Mobile Controller library relies on the HTML5 technology Websockets for communication between your web game and the player's phone. With a running Websockets server, the game's web page is able to receive controller input that is sent from the phone through the server and then to the game's web page. The controller is just another web page, so your game's controller can look and behave as you want it to.
